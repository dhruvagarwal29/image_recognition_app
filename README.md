# Image Recognition App

This web application allows users to perform image recognition tasks using a pre-trained machine learning model. It provides an interface for users to upload an image and receive predictions about the content of the image.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the app: [https://image-recognition-app-dhruvagarwal29.vercel.app/](https://dimage-recognition.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Node.js
- TensorFlow.js (MobileNet)

## Machine Learning Model

The image recognition functionality is powered by the MobileNet model from TensorFlow.js.
MobileNet is a lightweight, pre-trained deep learning model specifically designed for efficient on-device image classification.

For more information about MobileNet, refer to the [TensorFlow.js MobileNet documentation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet).

## Features

- Upload an image file for recognition
- Display predicted labels for the uploaded image
- User-friendly interface
